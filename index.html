    <h4>
      Senior Graphic Designer -
      <a href="https://cyberxstudio.co.uk/">CyberX Studio UK</a>
    </h4>
    <h5>Dec 2021- Dec 2023, London</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My primary responsibility involved building and maintaining strong,
        recognizable brand identities for over 15 of our key client accounts. I
        designed engaging graphics for 250+ static social media posts, 120+
        dynamic reels, and 80+ short-form videos for social media campaigns,
        email marketing, and digital advertisements—contributing to a 25%
        average increase in engagement and a 15% lift in overall campaign
        success.
      </li>
      <li>
        I created over 50 illustrations for magazines and digital publications,
        and designed 50+ collaterals including brochures, flyers, and event
        banners. I also developed visual content for physical environments, such
        as 20+ signage systems and custom wall art installations, helping retail
        and corporate spaces feel more engaging and on-brand.
      </li>
      <li>
        As part of my digital work, I developed user-friendly interfaces for
        over 8 websites using platforms like Shopify and Wix, ensuring a
        seamless and visually appealing user experience. I also applied basic
        knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to support customisation when
        needed, which enhanced design flexibility and site performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        To increase efficiency, I integrated AI tools like Midjourney, ChatGPT,
        and Adobe Firefly into my workflow for rapid concept development and
        automation of repetitive tasks—resulting in a 20% increase in design
        productivity. Throughout, I successfully managed 5–7 simultaneous
        projects at any given time, consistently meeting tight deadlines while
        maintaining high standards of creativity and quality.
